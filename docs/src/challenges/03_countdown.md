# Challenge 3 - Countdown

Program a countdown timer. One second is represented by an LED that is switched on. Start at 60 seconds and switch off an LED after every second. As soon as the timer has elapsed, all LEDs should flash.

```admonish tip title="Extension 1" collapsible=true
Show every 10 seconds a number with remaining time.
```

```admonish tip title="Extension 2" collapsible=true
Extend your program so that you can set the countdown time using the joystick.
```
